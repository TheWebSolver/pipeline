## Welcome
TheWebSolver Pipeline library follows the ðŸ”— Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern ðŸ”— to handle the given subject/request using pipes. The pipeline can accept any subject type, passes it through provided pipes and return the updated subject back.

## Installation (via Composer)

Install library using composer command:

```sh
$ composer require thewebsolver/pipeline
```

## Benefits
- Follows Chain of Responsibility design pattern by passing subject to pipeline handlers in order they were stacked.

	> Use _`Pipeline::through()`_ method to pass main handlers as pipe. Optionally, pass additional handlers using _`Pipeline::pipe()`_ method.

- Provides support for additional arguments that can be accepted by each handler passed using above methods.

	> Use _`Pipeline::use()`_ method to pass as many arguments as required.

- Provides support for catching [Pipe Exception][invalid] or [Unexpected Exception][unexpected] thrown by the handler.

	> Use _`Pipeline::sealWith()`_ method to pass a closure to handle thrown exception.

- Provides [bridge][b] for PHP Projects that implements [PSR-7][7], [PSR-15][15] (optional [PSR-11][11]) standards.

	> Use [Queue based Request Handler][q] implementation to handle stacked middlewares inside [Request Handler][h]'s handle method (_`RequestHandlerInterface::handle()`_).
